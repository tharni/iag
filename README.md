# IAG NZ Digital Frontend - Interview

The current implementation fetches the Lotus different models and display them on the UI. The URL is hardcoded inside the app
to only fetch the Lotus models. We would like to enable the customer to search the model and review the vehicle models.

Notes:
  We like SOLID and lots of tests. We're after someone that can preach the ways of clean code and help teach the wider teams.
  Please have a look at the current code structure and improve the code where you can (e.g. Use Redux, Redux Saga, ..., make
  sure you have Container and Presentational Components)
